# Library Management System

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Library Management System designed to efficiently organize and manage library resources. 

## Data Sources
In this project, I created and populated several tables to serve as the foundation for the Library Management System. Each table was designed to hold specific data relevant to the libraryâ€™s operations. The following tables were created:

#### Books Table: This table stores information about each book in the library, including fields such as:



book_id: Unique identifier for each book

book_name: Title of the book

book_author: Author(s) of the book

book_genre: Genre of the book

availability: Current availability status (available, checked out, etc.)



#### Readers Table: This table contains details about library patrons, with fields including:




reader_id: Unique identifier for each reader

first_name: Reader's first name

last_name: Reader's last name

email: Reader's email address

phone_number: Reader's phone number



#### Orders Table: This table tracks all book loan and return transactions, including:




order_id: Unique identifier for each order

reader_id: Reference to the reader borrowing or returning the book

book_id: Reference to the book being borrowed or returned

order_date: Date the book was borrowed

return_date: Date the book was returned

## Data Insertion
To populate these tables with sample data, I wrote SQL scripts that insert multiple entries, simulating real-world scenarios. This allows for comprehensive testing of the library management processes and ensures the system functions as intended.
